# Privacy Policy — Sunnah Sleep

**Last updated:** 2025

Sunnah Sleep ("the app") is designed with privacy in mind. This policy describes what data the app uses and where it is stored.

## Data storage

- **All personal data is stored only on your device.** Sleep logs, alarms, favorites, and settings are saved locally using your device’s storage (e.g. AsyncStorage). We do not operate servers that collect or store your data.

## Data we do not collect

- We do not collect your name, email, or any account information (the app does not require sign-in).
- We do not collect analytics, usage statistics, or identifiers for advertising.

## Location

- **Optional.** If you turn on “Use device location for prayer times” in Settings, the app uses your device’s location to:
  - Fetch prayer times for your area
  - Calculate Qibla direction
- Location is used only when the app is in use and only for these features. You can disable it in Settings; the app will then use a default location (e.g. London, UK) for prayer times.
- Location data is not sent to us; it is used only to call a third-party prayer-times API (Aladhan) and to compute Qibla. Coordinates may be cached on your device for performance.

## Notifications

- The app can send local notifications for alarms you set (e.g. bedtime, Fajr). These are scheduled and delivered by your device’s operating system. We do not send push notifications from a server.

## Third-party services

- **Prayer times:** When you use location-based prayer times, the app sends your coordinates to the [Aladhan API](https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api) to retrieve prayer times. Their privacy practices apply to that request. We do not store that API response on our servers.

## Children

- The app is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes

- We may update this policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will be revised when we do. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated policy.

## Contact

- For privacy-related questions, open an issue in the app’s repository or contact the developer listed in the app store listing.

# Localization — Sunnah Sleep

Based on [aso-skills localization](https://github.com/Eronred/aso-skills). Expand to new markets with localized metadata and keywords (not just translation).

## Market prioritization (Sunnah Sleep)

| Market | Language | Code | Priority | Notes |
|--------|----------|------|----------|--------|
| United States | English | en-US | 1 | Primary; already in app |
| United Kingdom | English | en-GB | 2 | Easy win, same copy |
| Saudi Arabia | Arabic | ar-SA | 3 | High fit; app has Arabic |
| UAE | Arabic | ar-AE | 4 | High fit |
| Indonesia | Indonesian | id | 5 | Large Muslim population |
| Malaysia | Malay | ms | 6 | Good fit |
| Pakistan | Urdu / English | ur / en-PK | 7 | Consider en-PK first |
| Turkey | Turkish | tr | 8 | Good market |
| Germany | German | de-DE | 9 | EU; run keyword research |
| France | French | fr-FR | 10 | EU |

**Choose by:** Market size, competition, effort (language/culture), strategic fit for Islamic app.

## Critical: keywords are NOT translations

Do **not** literally translate English keywords. Each market has different search behavior.

1. Run **keyword research per market** (local autocomplete, competitor keywords).
2. Use **local terms** (e.g. "Qibla" may stay; "sleep" → local equivalent).
3. Check what **top local apps** use in title/subtitle/keyword field.

**Example:**  
- EN: "sleep tracker", "prayer times"  
- Arabic: Research "تتبع النوم", "أوقات الصلاة", etc.  
- Indonesian: Research "tracker tidur", "jadwal sholat", etc.

## Localization checklist (per market)

- [ ] **Title** (30 chars) — Localized + main local keyword
- [ ] **Subtitle** (30 chars) — Local keywords, no repeat of title
- [ ] **Keyword field** (100 chars) — New research for this market; comma-separated, no spaces after commas
- [ ] **Description** — Translated and culturally adapted (not word-for-word)
- [ ] **Promotional text** — Local events (e.g. Ramadan)
- [ ] **What’s New** — Translated per update
- [ ] **Screenshots** — Text overlays translated; imagery appropriate (RTL for Arabic)
- [ ] **App preview video** — Subtitles or localized version if used

---

## Cultural adaptation

| Element | Check |
|---------|--------|
| Screenshots | Date/number format, currency if ever shown, RTL for Arabic |
| Colors | Avoid assumptions (e.g. green in some contexts) |
| Tone | Formal vs informal by culture |
| Features | Emphasize features that matter locally (e.g. Qibla, prayer times) |
| Social proof | Local press or “used in [country]” if relevant |

---

## Workflow

1. **Research (per market):** Top 10 apps in category, local keyword research, competitor metadata.
2. **Translate & adapt:** Native speaker + ASO context (“This is an App Store title; must include [keyword]”).
3. **Launch & monitor:** Submit, track keyword rankings and conversion by country, iterate.

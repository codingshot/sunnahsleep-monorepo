## How to pitch Apple

**Self-nomination:**  
https://developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/promote/

**Pitch structure**
1. App name and link  
2. One-sentence pitch  
3. What’s new (recent or upcoming)  
4. Apple tech you use  
5. Story angle (why now, human story)  
6. Timing (season, Ramadan, Apple event)  
7. Assets (screenshots, promotional art)

**Good times to pitch**
- 2–4 weeks before a major update  
- Before Ramadan or Islamic calendar moments  
- After adding WidgetKit / Live Activities / Shortcuts  
- After hitting 4.5+ rating and stability  

**Avoid**
- Right after a buggy release  
- When rating is below 4.0  
- No recent updates

## Pitch email template

```
Subject: Sunnah Sleep — Islamic sleep & prayer in one app

Hi App Store Editorial Team,

Sunnah Sleep is the only app that combines sleep tracking, Fajr and bedtime alarms, prayer times, Qibla, and evening adhkar in one place — with a privacy-first, on-device approach.

What makes us special:
- Single app for sleep + prayer + adhkar (no app clutter)
- Widgets for prayer times and sleep summary
- [Live Activities / Shortcuts if you have them]
- Strong ratings and growing user base

We’re [launching / just released] [update/feature] on [date]:
- [Feature 1 — tie to Apple tech if possible]
- [Feature 2 — user benefit]
- [Feature 3 — timeliness, e.g. Ramadan]

Our story: [2–3 sentences on why you built this and for whom]

Stats: [X.X] stars, [N] ratings, [brief growth or milestone]

We’d love to be considered for featuring. Happy to provide any extra assets or information.

[Your name]
[Developer / company name]
[App Store link]
```

## In-App Events (self-serve visibility)

Use for:
- **Ramadan** — “Ramadan sleep & prayer routine”
- **Major update** — “New: Widgets & Live Activities”
- **Challenge** — “7-day sleep streak challenge”

Best practices: Use full character limits, strong event artwork (1920×1080), schedule 2+ weeks ahead, run regularly.

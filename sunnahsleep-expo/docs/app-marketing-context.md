## Value Proposition

- **Problem:** Muslims want a single app for sleep routine, Fajr/bedtime alarms, prayer times, Qibla, and evening adhkar—without scattered apps or non-Islamic sleep content.
- **Target Audience:** Muslims (any age) who care about sunnah sleep habits, on-time Fajr, and adhkar; likely English and Arabic speakers.
- **Unique Differentiator:** Combines sleep log, Islamic alarms (bedtime + Fajr), prayer times, Qibla, and curated evening duas in one app; privacy-first (data on device).
- **Elevator Pitch:** Sunnah Sleep helps you build a blessed sleep routine with sleep tracking, Fajr and bedtime alarms, prayer times, Qibla, and evening adhkar—all in one app.

## Competitors

| App | Notes | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----|------|-----------|------------|
| Muslim Pro | Prayer + Qibla + content | Huge install base, many features | Cluttered; sleep/adhkar not focus |
| Pillow / Sleep Cycle | Sleep tracking | Strong sleep analytics | Not Islamic; no adhkar/alarms |
| Alarm apps (generic) | Fajr alarms | Simple | No prayer times, Qibla, or adhkar |
| Dua/adhkar apps | Evening adhkar | Focused content | No sleep or alarm integration |

**Positioning:** Sunnah Sleep is the only app that combines **sleep + Islamic alarms + prayer + Qibla + adhkar** in one place with a clean, focused experience.

## Goals

1. **Launch** — Publish on App Store and Play Store with strong metadata and screenshots.
2. **Discoverability** — Rank for "islamic sleep", "fajr alarm", "prayer times", "qibla", "adhkar", "sleep tracker" in primary markets (US, UK, Muslim-majority regions).
3. **Conversion** — Clear value prop and screenshots so store visitors understand the app and download.

## Resources

- **Budget:** Indie / minimal paid marketing at launch
- **Team:** Solo/small team
- **Tools:** EAS (Expo Application Services), store.config.json for metadata
- **Constraints:** No paid ASO tools (e.g. Appeeky) initially; rely on best-practice metadata and keyword field

---

## Markets

- **Primary:** United States (en-US), United Kingdom (en-GB)
- **Secondary:** Saudi Arabia, UAE, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan (consider localization later)
- **Languages:** English (en), Arabic (ar) in-app; store listing en-US first
